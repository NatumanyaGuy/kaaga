# Kaaga

Kaaga (_Rukiga_ for _'smell'_, could not find a translation for senseðŸ˜œ!) is a digital sensory analysis platform that enables evaluators to create and deploy digital questionnaires online to testers.
The idea for the platform came from our demand for an easy to use and sustainable way to get feedback on the different food products we've been developing over the years.  
The platform provides real-time results about the responses received from testers, allowing evaluators to gain insights into the sensory properties of their products.

## Features

- Create and customize digital questionnaires
- Up to 15 in-built test templates to start from
- Deploy questionnaires online to testers
- Get real-time results about responses
- Multilingual Support
- Export responses to .xlxs
- Generate QRCodes for digital questionnaires
- Analyze and visualize data to gain insights

## What we're hoping to add

- Collaboration features
- Advanced Analytics
- Data Visualization
- Authentication on Tester Side
- Conditional Logic (Dynamic Questionnaires)
- Tester Management

## Benefits so far

- Efficiency in data collection; since questionnaires have pre-defined input options, we're seen reduced cases of wrong entries.
- Real time insights; results from testers is fast making sure we waste no time and improve our products
- Customization of Questionnaires; we've been able to create "hype" around our brand and products even before they hit the market
- Reduced costs; by eliminating the need for physical testing facilities, printing, manual data entry and other costs associated with traditional data collection and entry.
- Amazing flexibility; we can test anywhere, we've had sensory evaluation sessions in local cinemas, waiting rooms and homes.

## Challenges we've faced or anticipated

- Technical Issues like Network access
- Technicality of Sensory Evaluation
- Data Security
- Backend Cloud Computing costs
- Limited Sensory Dimensions
- Device and Internet Connectivity issues
- Many Tests in the Field of Sensory Analysis are intellectual properies affecting integration into kaaga

## What we're doing or hoping to do to solve these challenges

- Use a Third party database provider - We're using Firebase for Authentication and Storage
- We hope to monetize the platform to increase sustainability
- We're engaging with researchers in the field of Food Science to develop sensory evaluation tests
- We're working on online resources such as; Youtube Channel, Blog etc., to help evaluators use the platform and guide them on how to do in-depth analysis of results.
